/* One nice thing about the FLIP animation method is that even though I am not
   directly changing the width/height of the element, the transition can still
   be faked by FLIP because it just calculates the transforms based the start
   and end positions and dimensions, no matter what CSS properties caused the
   positions and dimensions to change.

   The downside is that there might be strange-looking stretching of the
   contents of the element if the dimensions of the start and end states are
   too different. */
